The main idea behind it was to have a very lean toolset to build models that would be as simple to train as a Scikit-learn one, while offering the same level of flexibility as PyTorch. I wrote all about it &lt;a href="https://thedataist.substack.com/p/a-tiny-machine-learning-framework"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few versions later I&amp;rsquo;ve expanded on that base with a few much needed basic modules for machine learning - radial basis function networks, multi-head self attention, a &lt;a href="https://thedataist.substack.com/p/setting-up-data-based-tests-with"&gt;testing system that uses gold standard data from Backblaze&lt;/a&gt;, support for non-Scipy optimizers and more. In this release though I want to focus on the addition of two features that support research in one particular phenomenon: &amp;ldquo;grokking&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what is it!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Big Learning Set for Big World Helpers</title><link>https://stur86.github.io/s-plus-plus/posts/the-big-learning-set-for-big-world-helpers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 07:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stur86.github.io/s-plus-plus/posts/the-big-learning-set-for-big-world-helpers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On November 12, 2012, Randall Munroe&amp;rsquo;s famous xkcd comic published &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1133/"&gt;Up Goer Five&lt;/a&gt;, a blueprint and explanation of the Apollo V rocket written using only the 1000 most common words of the English language (as he estimated them). Later on, on November 24, 2015, came out &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/"&gt;Thing Explainer&lt;/a&gt;, an entire illustrated book of similar explanations for other objects and concepts. The &amp;ldquo;only the most common 1000 words&amp;rdquo; style of writing sounds sometimes stilted, sometimes a bit funny, but these texts certainly prove that it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; to talk virtually about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of LLMs, would it be possible to have a training set built only on the most common 1000 words of the English language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A blog is born</title><link>https://stur86.github.io/s-plus-plus/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stur86.github.io/s-plus-plus/posts/first-post/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="making-of-this-blog"&gt;Making of this blog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created for my computational science work, it&amp;rsquo;s a renderer for molecule and crystal structures in the browser using Three.js. It supports reading XYX, CIF, CELL and MAGRES formats, and allows plotting some additional visualization elements like ellipsoids or isosurfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python package providing some efficient and simple simulations of compartment models of dynamical systems, supporting both deterministic ODE solutions and the stochastic Gillespie algorithm. Originally developed in 2020 to help with epidemiological research during the COVID pandemic; was used for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7932151/"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://stur86.github.io/s-plus-plus/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stur86.github.io/s-plus-plus/about/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="about-me"&gt;About Me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Simone Sturniolo. I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer working in London. I got a PhD in physics back in Italy, at the University of Pavia, and then worked for a long time as computational scientist, writing code to help solve problems of atomic structure in solid matter. Now I&amp;rsquo;m working at a start-up developing a new biomedical device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-i-do"&gt;What I Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my personal projects I usually experiment for fun with building interesting things or exploring scientific ideas in domains like dynamical systems. I also occasionally develop games and may do some creative writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
